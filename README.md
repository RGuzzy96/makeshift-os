# MakeshiftOS

After pumping out Next.js after Next.js project, I got a little tired of strictly high-level application development and wanted to dig a little deeper. What better thing to do than try to write a simple OS from scratch then?

This OS will be designed to run in QEMU, and hopefully also on my Raspberry Pi 5.

This development is largely guided by the fantastic resources at:

- https://github.com/differrari/RedactedOS/tree/main
- https://www.rpi4os.com

This is an ongoing development, we shall see what OS features I implement and in which order - and I provide no guarantee that this code works.
